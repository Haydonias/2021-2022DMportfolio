  <div class="content">Hello! My name is Hayden Roberts. I am (at the time of witing this) 15-years-old. I love playng music, videogames, and my friends/family. I play guitar, piano, bass guitar, cello, and sing. I am also in two bands! My favorite artists are First Aid Kit, the Offspring, and System of a Down (but I also love Pearl Jam, Nirvana, and Weezer). My favorite videogames is "Starbound" developed by Chucklefish but I also love Terraria and Minecraft. I have two dogs named Sezzy and Sweety; on the Raster page I show both merged together. I have a little brother as well. I am an extrovert and I work well with almost everyone, I love to make friends too. I am a creative person and I also like writing (though Im not as good at that). I had a lot of fun in this class and would love to do something in this field especially the audio aspect. Tanks for checking out my work! If you have any questions click "Contact me".</div>
