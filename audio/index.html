	"Digital Spaceflight" from Dec. 2021
	  Digital Spaceflight Poem (starts when the drums do)

Sitting in the cockpit - 
Mechanics down below - 
Panels full of lighting - 
Engines set to go - 

You’ve been here in training - 
And You’ve been here in dreams - 
You take a look down at the ground - 
Before this spaceship leaves - 

People on the radio - 
But you know what to do - 
You brace your self for takeoff - 
The countdown gets to two - 

You sit there feeling ready - 
The engines start to hum - 
People waiting tensely - 
The countdown gets to one - 

You feel the pressure start to change - 
The force run through your hair - 
And for once your truly grateful - 
To be strapped down to a chair - 

As you rocket into space - 
You that you have done - 
Something only some will do - 
Before their setting sun - 

Now that you are up here - 
Something feels so strange - 
You feel so much lighter - 
In your mind and in your weight - 

There’s no intermission - 
Your up here on a mission - 
You unstrap and float around this place -  - 
That you now call your home - 

Pale blue sphere - 
Moon so near - 
Have no fear - 
Don’t shed a tear - 

You feel the pressure start to change - 
The force run through your hair - 
And for once your truly grateful - 
To be strapped down to a chair - 

As you sit here deep in space - 
You know that you have done - 
Something only some will do - 
Before their setting sun - 


Don’t forget who you are - 
Don’t forget what you are - 
Don’t forget where you are - 
Don’t forget who you are - 

Pale blue sphere - 
Moon so near - 
Have no fear - 
Don’t shed a tear - 

Pale blue sphere - 
Moon so near - 
Have no fear - 
Don’t shed a tear -
